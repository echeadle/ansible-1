This is the first example of building a server with ansible.  It will go step by step. The directory architectire is from the book Ansbile for Devops by Geerling. 

It will go step by step to building a complete architecture based on docker, and other servers to be decided later.  Maybe Django, or nginx.  It will have a load balancer and in the future some security monitoring stack. But the first step is to build a vagrant server with devops as the ansible user.
